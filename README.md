mcwebstats
==========

Minecraft server/player statistics standalone web application suite.

stats.php - a form script that reads and displays stats of a given user (currently as formatted JSON).

This only works on pre-1.7.6 minecraft servers.
Updates beyond this version use the new UUID system for naming stats files.
I am currently working on implementing the Mojang accounts API, but have not completed it yet.
